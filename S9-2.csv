1,Phyton                                                                                                                                                                   
2,Actually i have no idea what is popular in Business Analytics so i am not sure. Generally i will learn more programming skills 
3,"Actuall I am not sure, because I do not which software can be related to this course.But I do think it is important to teach other data analyzing tools. Such as matlab, tablue, python and so on. Maybe not in this course, but actually I think they are necessary skills students in bussiness analytics and dicision making science should be taught."
4,"data cleaning, manipulation, visualisation. Especially how to systematically cleaning raw data because it takes up a lot of time in practice"
5,"I wish that after the module, we can have our own report or product or a project to show to the employers in future interviews. Maybe you can provide different data in various industries and allow students to choose their interested one and finish a report"
6,"Python. It is quite similar to R, so it might be more easier to learn it after learning R. And it's also really popular in working places."
7,"I would like to learn how to use SPSS, SQL,Python etc. And i would like to be familiar with data mining."
8,Maybe python and R. Some related softwares which can give us support to investigate will be helpful if we have the opportunity to learn these
9,"R prgramming for business analysis. R programming is useful, intellegent and easy to use, which can be used to solve business problems."
10,Text Mining， we want to learn how to use Python to do data analysis since most of the companies chose to use Python as a prior tool for mining data. 
11,"May be SPSS , some software skills we can learn and practice more(Java). Or linux？ some software language we can learn I think hh!"
12,"I'm planning to learn python and finance and consulting knowledge in the future.
study for CFA or other certificates."
13,"For example, I prefer more actual financial topics and more business dataset to analyze and evaluation model by using R"
14,I would like to learn how to use Tableau to improve the visualisation of business analytics after completing this module. 
15,"python, advanced skills about the Excel like vab, and more knowledge about time series, there is a liitle about time series."
16,"Big data, spark
AI BI
analytics application in finance and general business
customer analysis
risk analysis
optimisation and simulation
modeling skills
predictive model

"
17,Maybe python. I heard that python is also a popular analysis software and is used by many companies. The ability to use both R and python may help get a good job.
18,"Python! Can't believe there is no Python modules in our programme.
Also, I still don't know much about data preparation."
19,"I would like to learn more about Python, and also some topics related to cognitive analysis after completing this module."
20,"data mining and text analytics, and also some Python skills for that. and I feel like knowledge about SQL database is also very important in work, maybe some learning topics about it can be provided. "
21,"Python, more artificial intelligence techniques used in a business analytics perspective, such as application of regression and classification models for specific business purposes"
22,"I would like to learn more data analytics software skills after completing this module, for example, tableau, python, SQL, SPSS. Although some of the classes already covered some of these skills, but I need to do more practice and improve further."
23,I would like to learn python. I would like to learn more data preprocessing techniques for R and other languages 
24,I wanna learn Python!! emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I'm very glad to join this module as This is a module I get the most knowledge Hhhh.
25,"Maybe python, since it’s more widely used in computer language. However the most important thing for me now is to become more proficient with the techi and able to apply those into real specific cases. "
26,"I want to know more about SPSS,JAVA ,R and to distinguish differences among them. I think there must be some advantages in specific areas."
27,The first one is python because so many companies require employees to have the ability. SQL could be the second one because most queries could be finished by it effectively. Besides I want to learn more about Tableau because I feel it so efficient to do some visualizations and basic analysis.                                       
28,"python........
as i notice, most of the company in china would prefer python rather than R, or they would like to use SQL instead to complete the data analysis ,however the emphasis of this module is put on R and pay no attention to python , i don't know the industry trend in the uk, maybe people prefer r here but i need to study some other language if i want to find a job in china
"
29,"Some topic like: Text mining 
some models like: Price prediction model
I would like to learn Python after completing this module."
30,Python. It is widely used in nowadays workplace. Using machine learning skills and the data analysis skills could help with the career.
31,"Maybe Python, but I haven't considered because I haven't fully understood the current module content"
32,"idonthaveitrightnow                                                                                                                     
sdfsdfsfsdfwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwww




"
33,"I will prefer to Python learning after completing this module. Python  is very popular in data mining and analysis in recent year, I believe that this skill will stongly strengthen my competitiveness in job seeking."
34,"Some techniques from python or SPSS. Python has become the most popular programming language around the world. If I get some knowledges of that technique, It will help me a lot in my work."
35,"after completing the module, I think I will continue figure out how to use R in the business situation, and maybe will learn python "
36,"More in-depth in SQL. Although we have been exposed to RStudio, I think Python will be key to our development as well. "
37,SQL .                         .                           .                .

39,".What other business analytics topics, methods or software skills would you like to learn after completing this module? "
40,"1. Python is the one that I want to learn.
2. Actually, I would like to learn a little bit more about how to use the algorithms rather than how is the algorithm itself implemented."
41,i would like to study the visual based for analyse some scheduling problems and also RStudio is so important for further learning.
42,"python and more real business topic .sometimes the practical is too academic, i lack the interst to do it well, if there is more real example and new example, i believe we will learn better and also more team work."
43,"No I just want to learn python P-Y-T-H-O-N.
Only 5 characters.
I don't have any other software I want to learn at the moment."
44,I want to learn some methods to analyze the datasets and collect datasets. Python is a software for to learn to deal with datas and analyze datas. 
45,I would like to learn how to use tableau because tableau is a very interesting and powerful software. It provides people a tool to easily visualise data.
46,"Python! Many companies in China require Python skills when recruiting for data analysis jobs. While R is very useful, adapting to the market can help me find a job."
47,"Python   may     be    useful       for        us     
and  R   is     also    help.       Maybe   we    can   learn   both "
48,"Python. Matlab. Modeling. Python has been the most popular and useful tool now and it can do many things. The latter two is related to maths, which is my favorite subject. "
49,"SQL, spark.  I would like to learn statistic math and algorithm, and I would like to learn some practical examples to know how to apply those skills. "
50,"I believe maybe we should learn something more about data processing, because I think we did not have a enough practice about code. by the way, I believe teaching Python may be useful, because its popular in the real companies."
