1,Coding in R and the different models we have seen in the classes.                                                                                        
2,"Those prediction model, because i don't find them in other modules.  Different algorithm can provide different solution sometime, so it is not bad to know more"
3,I think the most important skilss I have learn  in this mode is R programming. I have never learned to use R before and I think this course helps me a lot lo know about it and use it. I think it is a very important coz I believe R sudio is very useful for doing data analyzing and this can help me find a suitable job.
4,"self-learning, bc the lecture and practical sessions only provide the basic knowledge and more trail and error need to be conducted by ourselves"
5,programming skills and help me know more about prevelant usage of models and leave more for me to explore the code
6,"from this module, we learnt a lot of different forecasting method with R language. They are useful in my future career"
7,"The important skill I have learnt is definitely to analysis the data set in R, which is quite useful for me if i gona doing some analyzing works."
8,The critical thinking ability and group cooperation. It helps me to improve my thinking method and give me more information to get a more complete and high quality decision. 
9,"R prgramming for business analysis. R programming is useful, intellegent and easy to use, which can be used to solve business problems."
10,"Forecasting and data analyzing, it helps a lot to my future career and I hope it can make me more competitive in the human resources market"
11,The use of R to do the forecasting such as I can predict the stock price and so on if l will work in the relevant area of this
12,"how to write code. 
dealing with data using R is very effective and I've learned many important algorithms and methods
"
13,"time series analysis, factor analysis. 
Because it is useful in the industry which need to analyze the trend and to identify the most important factor."
14,I believe that time series forecasting is the most practical skill not only in research but also at work. It is a vital tool for forecasting and analysis which can be applied in many areas.
15,"R skills, basically is my favorite part about this courese. It helps me to learn more about using programming to analysis. however I think should put more analysis thinking releated R in this module"
16,"Analytical thinking.
Because, it provides me solutions for daily problems. Now I am more confident I have a more structured way of thinking whenever I encounter a new problem and understand what to do next. "
17,"Find the trend, make the line smooth and make reasonable predictions are all important. Analysis focuses on looking for the relationship in several variables."
18,"Self-learning skills haha. Methodologies were simply introduced during lectures, so we still have to spend a lot of time to understand the meanings of parameters and outputs.
"
19,"The most important skill I have learnt in this module is coding. And  its behind logic is important as well.
it's the 'language' to help me understand the data."
20,using R to solve some practical problems.  it's now widely used for many jobs. very important not only for business analytics but also for data analytics
21,"Dimensionality reduction techniques s.a. PCA, optimisation algorithms. Important because multivariate data sets often need dimension reduction, and optimisation algorithms are applicable to numerous problems."
22,"Data analysis is the most important skill I have learnt in this module. We use R in practical session to analyze data, then get deeper understanding and more information. Data analysis is crucial in both academic and business. It Is useful for my future career and improve my critical thinking. R studio is worth to learn, the code are flexible and easy to understand, they can be adjusted in terms of your need."
23,"A more in depth understanding of R, this is important for future job prospects and essential for analytics careers"
24,It must be time series as I plan to work in finance field. this model can help me to predict the price of stock. So I am very happy about this method.
25,"I think is the logic behind computer language. Once I finger this out, it will do a great help on learning other any new language. "
26,"Programming and analysing skills. Before studying this module, I have no idea and no concept with Rï¼ŒSPSS and some professional knowledge about computer and data analytics. 
However, I have concept and understanding about data analytics and I know how to analyse business strategy  with professional datasets."
27,Time series and text analytics may be the most helpful skills because in finance time series can do so much work to help to forecast stock price and text analytics are very closely related to nowadays textual information mining.
28,"time series forecasting
time series are widely seen in  our daily life and cover almost every  aspect of our life ,if we can master the ability to do data forecasting by analyzing time series data, then we can make full use of these data and find the inner link between the data."
29,"Programming skills(R)
Because it provides me a method to analyze and visualize data, and also do some predictions.I think it would help a lot in my future career."
30,Logical and software skills. The logical skill are basic requirements for the data analysis and the software skills help a lot in the data analysis process.
31,"R programing skills, it can make me more competitive in future career and a  job related to data analysis can make a lot of money"
32,"principal component analysis and factor analysis
ewef            
dsdfsfddweweeeeewwwwwwwwwwww                                                                                                    "
33,"Although forecasting is not completely precise, we will try to find the regulation and potential results or changes in the future which might be important in business world to help make decisons such as order policy, demands forecasting or any other future plan."
34,The techniques in R is the most important I think. R is so powerful in data analysis and many companies use r.
35,"every thing in this session is  really useful, forecasting plays a really important role in the business environment"
36,"Basically, forecasting techniques and optimization skills. In the Supply chain sector, you will need a lot of these skills in your daily activities. "
37,I think the most important skill I have learned is practical skill. Using software to cope with some really questions is fun.                                      .                 .                               .                                        .             .

39,What are the most important skills you have learnt in this module and why do you believe they are so important? 
40,"I know many names of algorithms,  but it seems that I haven't understood them totally. if there is an explanation when we are having seminars, we will have a better understanding and control over the knowledge."
41,i think reduce dimensions is improtant for us to find out some essential factors when something is complicate and has lots of elements.
42,"r skill and data analyses logic, if we want to use this skill in our future work, it is essential for us to know well about r at first, and we should have the ability to learn other software as soon as possible."
43,"I think the most important skill is how to use R studio and Excel to analyze lots of data.
it's really useful in the real life."
44,The way to understand the different use of forecasting methods. It can push me to think the suitable methods when I think about a question.
45,The content about data analysis and how to do it with R. That is very practical and useful and you literally learn how to do it.
46,"That must be R. Because I want to do data analysis in the future, R language is very important. And, machine learning increases my chances of getting a job in the future."
47,forecasting                                                 forecasting                                                 forecasting                                                 forecasting                                                 forecasting                                                 
48,"R, data analysis skill. These are the hard skill for analysis and the basic of further analysis. It is the skill that the HR would probably ask for."
49,"the ability to understand data, because of the trend of big data, the demand for skilled employees will increase. "
50,"the skill to forecasting  and  class data. Because nowadays, everything is depends on data, and the data that we can access is also increasing significantly, therefore, understand a skill to forecasting data is helpful in my career and daily life."
